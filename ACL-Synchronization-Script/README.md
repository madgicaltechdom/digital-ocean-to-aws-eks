# Document for ACL Synchronization Script

This document provides an overview and usage guide for a script designed to synchronize Access Control Lists (ACLs) between DigitalOcean Spaces and AWS S3 buckets. The script allows users to copy the ACL settings from objects in a DigitalOcean Spaces bucket to corresponding objects in an AWS S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js programming.
- Access to DigitalOcean Spaces and AWS accounts with appropriate permissions to access and modify bucket ACLs.
- AWS SDK for JavaScript installed (aws-sdk package).

## Script Overview

The script utilizes the AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with DigitalOcean Spaces and AWS S3. It performs the following tasks:
1. Sets up AWS S3 clients for DigitalOcean Spaces (doS3) and AWS S3 (awsS3).
2. Defines a function (checkAndUpdateACL) to:
    - List objects in the DigitalOcean Spaces bucket with the specified prefix.
    - Iterate through each object and check its ACL.
    - Update the ACL of the corresponding object in the AWS S3 bucket to match the ACL obtained from DigitalOcean Spaces.
3. Defines helper functions (checkObjectACL and updateObjectACL) to respectively check the ACL of an object in DigitalOcean Spaces and update the ACL of an object in AWS S3.
4. Calls the checkAndUpdateACL() function to initiate the ACL synchronization process.

Script Configuration: Before running the script, users need to replace the placeholder values in the script with their actual credentials and bucket details:
